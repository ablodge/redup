45	the the	DT	Because we aren't responsible for the actions of our forebears ? We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man . And we've tried . We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action , diversity quotas and scholarships that white people ( even ones as poor or poorer ) don't get . They don't want change . The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution . What do they want from us ? To abolish police and law ? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals ? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in ( and as a measurable consequence , an increase in crime ) ? The cause of their problems lie in two places : The actions of a misguided " community " in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them . The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress . The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime . It only makes more racists . And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level . How do you change the mind of the individual ? I'm not completely sure . Nobody really is . If black rioters / criminals started taking responsibility for their actions , made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity , white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies . Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness , being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated , you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you . ( and I'm not saying this is how it should be , it's just how it is )

564	much much	RB	I think his recovery is perfect the way it is . I think it was in melee too . His is a much much better example of a glass cannon than melee fox . I think both the up b and side b allow for great mix ups overall but have definite weaknesses ( length , end lag , no hitboxes on start up for up b etc ) I don't think it needs to be messed with at all . I think fox's is one that should get a second look though , along with a few others

Don't have TC yet or that would be the next thing cause it does seem to heat up a bit when chain-vaping .

978	had had	VBD	Any human interaction can be seen as a form of teaching . When I was Pre-K I was taught to tie my shoes , I learned to read , etc . What you get out of school is a combination of what you put in , what others put in , and the materials or intelligence among those involved . Case in point - I hated math at a younger age , until I found a teacher that had a disposition that nothing you could say or do could make her mad . She LOVED algebra and she loved teaching . If I had had more teachers like her in my elementary math classes , I would probably have loved math previous to her . TL ;D R - A good teacher , a good mentor , is a big deal at any age .

I hate the raiders but but they have some sexy uniforms and these remind me of those .

There's no way to argue that that is the case any more than there is an argument to sell them . Plus , his demeanour to the whole idea was crass . I'm not against ' voting with your wallet ' . I'm against his perspective overall on Chromas .
3605	it it	PRP	That's an interesting Theory . Since I'm an engineer and not a theoretical particle physicist , I enjoy working with tangible objects instead of weird little matter bugs . So that kind of theoretical drive is too beyond my understanding to offer a comment to the affirmative or negative . However , it sounds plausible . If a particle was spun ( enough to provide a measurable , useful change in space-time ) and shot by a compact particle accelerator ( or it could drift into it , who am I to judge a lazy particle ? ) into an energy uptake system on the other side , I can see that working . This field change would need to be modulated to provide more efficient " forward " travel through space-time . Modulated or given an " anti-spin " ( as I see it it my head ) to cause a ( to me ) a necessary opposite shift in space time at the other end . Where a higher point mass might cause a contraction of space time on one end , and a higher " anti " mass would cause an expansion . My use of anti doesn't mean I'm necessarily suggesting spinning an anti particle , because I don't know much about antimatter and the like and their properties . I just mean " do the opposite on the other end " . It's might be possible that doing the same thing to something else might produce expansion . It's also possible that a different method is the only way of doing that and the uptake system could power that too . Who knows . But yeah I really like your input . I might contact you about your opinions while I do these articles . I'd also like to get drunk and have a conversation about this stuff with you . I believe that would be a good time . My brain hurts less when I think about things like this from a very specific view point for too long . It's not that it's necessarily hard , just that I start picturing ( or trying to ) 4th dimensional effects when my brain is so firmly rooted in flatland .

4302	that that	DT	> All that that shows is that saving humanity is preferable is preferable to not saving it . Assuming that that's not an option , prolonging the inevitable is seen as preferable to going quietly into the night . But ... then that's just straight up evil . It's the deliberate and premeditated murder of another human being ( s ) without even the dubious ' justification ' of saving everyone else . Acknowledging that but excusing it through a utilitarian point of view opens up moral relativism , which is the ethics equivalent of saying ' well that's just * your * opinion . ' > This is essential what OP wants to debate ; not so much the morality of sacrificing a child from a utilitarian perspective ( because any utilitarian worthy of the name is obviously going to argue that it's morally obligatory ) but rather whether utilitarianism itself is moral . And there's the rub . Utilitarianism is effectively the promotion of the necessary or lesser evil , which is * still evil . * It's a plainly amoral philosophy , and OP knows that or he wouldn't have said " I know this is a utilitarian argument but ... " That " but " let's you know he's about to dismiss the problems with utilitarianism . Which means he knows it's wrong but doesn't care because * results * and you can't really argue against that .

4792	in in	IN	The beauty of CB is the flexibility of the weapon . Have a hammer bro ? Go for tail . Have a GS ? Go for head to KO . Have both ? Go for feet and get trips . You can go for big hits and KOs or you can stay in in sns mode forever with a status CB . Fill whatever role the team needs and you'll be guaranteed better clear times and more broken parts . I try not to overlap because CB is very prone to tripping , but with good positioning , you can easily share a head with hammer if you really need the KO . Also a word of caution with GPs , while there are people with the requisite skill , I tend to not use them online unless I'm in a bad spot . It's fine to try to style on the monster solo , but if I miss the GP online , I'll get hit , be in axe mode when I get out , and get hit by a follow up attack because Im too slow . Definitely carted to this many times . Most of the time after you get a GP , you should be looking to evade the next attack since monsters get so aggressive in g rank . Thus , you probably shouldn't have been there in the first place . I try to combo such that it takes me through and past the monster . For example , there's an opening head on , X + A to dash in -> charge A -> X + A -> X + A -> R to charge shield -> evade forward . That should take you all the way through the monster and a good distance behind him . The side evades are great for this too . Where you finish your combo is just as important as when you start and the CB has great tools for this to make up for it's lower walk and sheath speed . Hope that helps and sorry for the long winded answer !

5470	the the	DT	How are they calculating the amount of fans for each sport ? I honestly find it hard to believe most of these sports beat the NFL in viewership . Also , while the the sports themselves might be more popular because they're spread around multiple countries , this also means that each sport has multiple professional leagues with their own profits . For football , there's really just the NFL . One league , 16 games , and fans watch every one . I'd be surprised if the NFL weren't the most profitable sports league .

5559	people people	NNS	Yeah , it comes with 10 of them in yellow . It also a cool synth because it teaches you to let go - did a patch , had fun with it , and then you reset everything to make something new . Because of this it actually encourages experimentation . Its inability to store patches is also its main drawback as it makes for a poor stage synth - you can only use it for one sound during your performance . Even though I've seen many big name artists use original ones on stage many people people " grow out " of them and move on to more advanced digital or digitally controlled synths . Here are some actually some cool tips for it , which also show additional capabilities of the thing : https://youtu.be/jglbXy2tN20?list=PL2Y43eupOAVWhx_1j_VdvpYArHulB0c7m Here is an official Korg demo that shows that it also can sound smooth : https://youtu.be/fSnzCWA_JWI Another thing to mention : You seem fairly new to this synth game . So I just wanted to point out that many times synths are being paired with reverb and delay , just like in the video you found . It gives them more body and spaciousness . If you'll find your synth sounding " stale " and you use an amp you can also get a Zoom MS - 70CDR pedal which features decent emulations of many popular effects . Just don't get fixed on effects pedals and shit . A proper synth can actually fake many of them . Or more like a good synth programmer can . Just focus on learning synthesis and you will achieve great results . Don't worry if you can get good or memorable sounds out of your synth at first - it will come with experience . And don't think you've reached the limits of the synth - there is always more . PS : As an example of a latter statement , I got my hands on one of them Volca Keys synths and to me it seemed more like a toy - a very simple and limited synth . I thought : not much can be done with it . And then : https://youtu.be/0WpZZjy8MkU , https://youtu.be/__C4pICe83U and https://youtu.be/GYLRtWk9wgE .

5859	to to	TO	The only way the injectors meter fuel is by the amount of time they are open so more fuel pressure would cause more fuel to be injected in the same amount of time . So yes you increasing the pressure caused it to to run rich and even if the fuel pressure is lower than recommended but the afr is good I'd say you're set . Was this a turbo engine stock because if not that could be why the fuel pressure is different than recommended .

6580	have have	VB	> how is it that the German car manufacturers there have been so slow to go electric ? They probably know the German market . My first guess is the population density in Germany compared to the US . It's 226 per km² or 583 per square mile in contrast to 34.2 per km² (8 8.6 per square mile ) in the US . As a consequence , most people live in urban environments , ie . flats . It's hard to put solar on your roof when you don't own the roof . Charging at home becomes a problem when your car has no fixed parking space . My second guess is the vacation culture . Our annual vacations are kind of a big deal here where tons of people drive down to Italy , or Spain in the summer . Many of them use their own car . This is important for them , so range anxiety might be higher than in the US . My third guess is an established car nut culture . There was once a test of car dealers with researchers pretending to be potential buyers asking for hybrids or electric cars . In the better cases , the sales men were ignorant . In the worst cases , they spread lies and falsehoods . Also , journalists in established magazine like Auto Motor Sport are sometimes skeptical about electric cars , to put it mildly . Finally , from my personal point of view , the Model S may look awesome from the outside , but the interior is a bit too much like a US car , and these do not have have a very good reputation here . So , hybrids are currently a better bet for car makers .

7938	very very	RB	The poverty excuse is bullshit . I grew up with very very little money , at times sleeping on a foam mat on top of a treadmill in the living room of a relative . My parents never went after government assistance and we still managed to survive . Sure we had to mow lawns and do work for neighbors to support the family and missed out on presents for holidays but there was no need to actually rob something . It's just them being greedy and not understanding the difference between wants and needs . Before anyone says " oh you grew up in a white community " no I didn't . I grew up in a predominately black community , had a gun pulled on me twice , and had a friend get shot in the head at 13 years old from a drive-by shooting where he was simply standing in front of his house . I'm really fucking sick of them using the same old excuses every day . " It's the community " " They didn't have enough money " . It's all bullshit
8122	in in	IN	I have no idea what you mean by " jump right in " or how such a thing would be a caveman tactic . I'm assuming you mean jumping in in a physical manner , and I wouldn't advocate escalating things like that unless it was really necessary . Being a bitch , though ... That , I advocate . It's always hard to say how someone would react in the moment with situations like this , but when he kept telling her to be chill , I think my preferred response would be " This is as chill as I get . I think you need to go back to your own table . " It always depends on the personality of who you're dealing with though . I wouldn't go instantaneous full bitch mode with any stranger that tried to talk to me , but it sounds like this guy overstayed his welcome when he wasn't welcome in the first place , noting OP's mention of her obvious death glare .

8946	short short	RB	But Pitt becoming famous is due to him having great looks . If he was ugly , then he would have been passed over for many of the roles he landed . Being pretty is a large reason actors land roles . If they are horrible actors they are still going land jobs but not as many . Brad Pitt partially became famous for his role in legends of the fall and all the girls absolutely dawned over him and he landed a lot of roles because of women's reaction to him . The Sex trade has been around longer the Christians have believed Jesus and the bible . This not going to change males are biologically programmed , with some exceptions , to be physically attracted to women at a very animalistic nature . Society as a whole has tried to change this few 100s of years but you can't get around it . Women wearing low tops , short short , yoga pants etc are playing on this primal male Sex drive . They are using it to their advantage to get ahead or gain something . Men use their own privledges to get ahead . If some give a waitress a bigger tip based on their look that their issue . Do I judge people ? Ofcourse I do , but I realize that I'm judging someone and try to change my perception or reaction . You nor I have any right to complain or bitch about how someone else lives their lives . And if u do feel you have the right to do this then you should be okay when some interrupt your life or ability to make a living based solely based on their judgment of you . Women are playing a game with men and it's one they choose to play by accepting these roles or jobs or lifestyle . You can disagree with this choices and live your life differently but by now means are you living a more worthy , or more important life then them .

9759	very very	RB	The Witcher series is a very very lore based game . The Witcher 3 is going to have plenty of cutscenes and a ton of dialogue / choices to make . So the Witcher 2 didnt even come close to 80 or even 10 % of just cutscenes . I suppose if you rushed through it and did nothing but main story quests you would tend to spend more time in them or if you consider dialog cutscenes ? If anything I would bet Witcher 3 is going to have way more cutscenes than previous titles . However in a 50hr straight playthrough its probably still only a few hours at most total . Just trying to be honest and say it doesn't sound like your type of game . Chances are it will win several GOTY awards especially in the RPG categories . So its going to be an amazing game but that doesn't have to mean its your type of game .

10710	etc etc	FW	You are absolutely correct , we have no way of knowing ; that relationship could have ended for any number of reasons , his fault , her fault , or nobodies . But many relationships do end after the birth of a child and the new parents being unable to adjust to the new dynamic , particularly with new fathers having issues of not feeling respected , valued or important . Considering the lack of understanding shown in the original post at age 30 , I'm doubtful OP was more understanding in his lower 20s , and I'm sure there are plenty of mistakes to learn from . This seems pretty classic stressed out new mom and frustrated father not communicating and taking out their frustration by sniping at each other . Yeah , mom shouldn't be taking every opportunity to belittle dad , but dad telling new ( probably exhausted ) mom to back off because she isn't doing anything around the house is the opposite of helping . > Me : ( goes back to bed after taking son to school ) > Her : Are you going to wake up now ? You got shitty with me about going to bed last night , are you going to sleep all day ? > Me : I'm awake , my stomach hurts , I didn't think my sleep schedule was a democratic process . > Her : Well there are still dishes from last night that need to be done ! > Me : You need to lay off , you haven't done anything but laundry for months , I made dinner last night , and took the trash out this morning , etc etc , I don't give you shit about it > Her : Well I want to vacuum today so you need to get up . ( storms off ) The above exchange shows two people who seem to have no respect for what the other is doing and one of them is going to have to make the first move for a while in appreciating the other and not making the situation worse . Since OP is the one here asking for help , and has gone through a new child before , he is probably best choice for making that first move .
10746	have have	VB	Try this painful but sometimes workable script . " Can you help me ? Who can help me ? Can you transfer my call to them ? " If they say no , ask for their supervisor or higher up . If they insist they do no have have such a person , ask who else you can speak to . Or insist they do , and maybe repeat the original script . Then continue with whomever you get transfered to . You may go in circles . Write down the names of the people you speak to . Be polite . You may go around more than once , and you don't want them to hang up I pulled a full weekend this one time . Got to know a few people . Built some rapport . They ultimately put me in touch with a technician who solved my problem . He was confused and weirded out . But the thing continues to be fixed . Fucking time consuming . But possibly effective . Especially once some supervisor people speak to you multiple times , and start to realise you're not going away . Be personable , and funny if you can .
10908	in in	IN	Yes , you can plug the drives in in any combination . Whichever one is booted from will be the active OS drive , and the rest will just be storage drives with a dormant OS on it . The only issue you might have going back to the 2TB backup is programs . Most programs installed to the 4TB will also make registry changes on the SSD's installation . If you then not from the 2TB drive then those registry values won't exist and programs that depend on those values won't run . My suggestion , after the SSD is up and running , wipe the 2TB drive , make an image of your SSD , and store it on the 2TB or 4TB drive . Then , if the SSD dies or the OS gets hosed you can just restore that image . Periodically remake the image so it doesn't fall to far behind . Also , sign up for DropBox or GoogleDrive and save your important documents in the cloud . They will be automatically synched so you have an off-site , professionally-managed backup of critical documents .

11437	so so so	RB	I agree with you that calling " trigger " in an argument in an attempt to censor someone is bad . I just see the whole " OMG you're triggering me " satire posts so so so often , while I see the attempt to censor pretty much no where . I agree that there are a lot of children on tumblr that complain about a lot of stupid things . But a bunch of children and " a few news articles " about college kids who think they have everything all figured out ( like a lot of people in college think ) hardly warrant how much reddit likes to make fun of them . Regarding your point about PTSD and psychology , I also agree that never confronting your traumatic situation is probably bad . However , I don't believe that many psychologists would agree that trigger warnings are a bad thing . Again , just because someone is choosing not to think about a traumatic experience in a given moment , it doesn't mean they're trying to block it out forever .

11503	other other	JJ	I should clarify my point . I agree with you when you say that ethnic tribalism is something to consider . But you seem to have been arguing that ethnic tribalism is good and * should * be the only thing to consider . I am not just arguing that class is a factor , but that class should be * the * most important factor in solidarity and pan-ethnic struggle . For example , it doesn't make any sense at all for low-wage South Asian workers to ally themselves with the South-Asian-lead business councils and lobbyist groups--their interests are entirely opposite . It does make sense , however , for them to ally with Latino immigrants , for example . Likewise , back in the ' 60s , it * should * have made sense for White and Black workers in midwestern industrial cities to ally with one another--but too many White workers were held back because of their racial tribalism and White supremacist attitudes , and everybody was weakened because of it . On other other , during this same time period , many Black and White people in the ghettos of Chicago successfully organized alongside one another to address issues of poverty and police violence , and forged an incredibly powerful alliance . All in all , I would argue that economic dynamics are hugely influential in impacting how social and political dynamics play out . As such , organizing with class in mind can and should be a way to cut across racial lines and fight for a better world .

He's a billionaire , he wants to drive audis all the time , no problem . the one with hawkeye and romanov was the one too far . The other stuff ... couldnt care less . Banner has the * most legitimate reason ever * to want to unwind . Full size headphones are more immersive . beats is a popular brand . put on beats . Its not like they were name dropped like trans 4mers . or " Bruce , take of those high quality beats personal sound system " " I cant Natasha , with ultra crisp highs from Beats proprietary mixing technology , these beats are unstoppable . " Quicksilver should just wear ' Shoe brand ' shoes ? adidas and eastern europe have a pretty strong connection . hmmm it seems product placement and what constitutes product placement is apparently a big deal to me . i just hate when people see a brand in one shot and immediately scoff . even though thats what the real world is like

12540	no no	DT	No , I don't mind people who choose to act and adopt the personality of the opposite gender , except think they're a little weird . But if you've literally convinced yourself and lied to others that you are the opposite gender , you're mentally ill . Please don't recognize yourself as a female , but a M2F transgender or vice versa . Queue the downvotes . I know a lot of people get pissed off at people like me for thinking like this , but please be honest with yourself , if you're a man , you're a man . If you're a woman , you're a woman . You're free to behave differently , but don't lie to yourself or other people . EDIT : for illustration , imagine i went into a female bathroom and was held up by girls asking what i was doing there . i exclaim ' no no , it's cool ! i'm a girl ! ' should i be denied access to the bathroom because i haven't made any effort to look like a girl ? why does it matter what i look like ? if i ' believe ' i'm a girl i should be able to pee from my penis in here !

12833	had had	VBD	I'm sorry you are feeling this way , its a really tough adjustment ! Big hug to you ! Can someone come and hold the baby so you can take a nap , take a long shower , or go get a haircut ? Getting my haircut when baby was 5 weeks old was magic ! A friend had thoughtfully given me a gift card for my shower , lovely lady that she is ! Just sitting in the chair and not doing anything , just letting someone take care of me for half an hour was incredibly relaxing . And then I was actually happy to get home to baby , because I had had a break . Just something that makes you feel more like yourself and not simply your new title of " mom " ? Or do you feel like you are experiencing depression ? If so please talk to your doctor . Either way , you are not alone . It is so overwhelming to go home to a completely new reality , and be responsible for someone you love so much , but that is simultaneously exhausting !

13662	the the	DT	I would be a fairly simple task using an Arduino microcontroller and a stepper motor . You could program the the Arduino to dispense food at regular intervals or when the bowl is empty . The stepper motor is easily controlled with the PWM pin . You can find Arduino's on Amazon for around $ 20 . You could likely use a small stepper motor salvaged from an old inkjet printer if you have one kicking around . Better yet . Here is an Instructable from someone doing something very similar . http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controled-dog-foodtreat-dispenser/
13762	that that	DT	I have done exactly that already . Palat's front foot remains on the ice the entire time until it makes contact with Glendening's skate ( skate on skate contact ) . He leans into the hit , he does not propel himself forward in a jumping motion . I do believe that that was Kronwall's intention , to turn into the hit and hit him with his backside as you said . But he's too late for that and that motion is what propels him in a leaping motion directly into Kucherov's head .

Otherwise ? I'm really , really glad she's not my doctor !
14085	to to	TO	that's a super generalized understanding of how the Communists seized power . people weren't pissed at land owners , they were pissed about power relations and given sufficient tools to shape the political and economic landscape to their own , they found all sorts of just-so rationales to do so . ' historical grudges ' was , at the provincial level , a superficial ploy to seize land and wealth and political power . Mao may have believed his own ideals but the practical reality was that this allowed for Communist cadre to completely usurp local holdings with the promise that they would soon be the ones who were the community leaders , builders , and bankers why do you think corruption is so systemic to the Chinese system ? if people were really about grudges and wealth inequality then fuck me , you'd think China would at least be reasonably equitable but it's a far sight from what you'd call an egalitarian society . my great grandparents died in labor camps and my mother's side lost a fuckload of land and holdings during the revolt . and you can bet your ass that those holdings were not redistributed fairly to the community and you can bet your ass that my great grandparents weren't thrown in labor camps for ideology so much as their community standing come up with the justifications that you want to to rationalize your bad argument but please don't believe this fairy tale rendition of Chinese history
14106	that that	IN	Basically I ran with a crew of a few guys that got themselves into shit over and over again , after they got two different camps raided and destroyed in the span of two weeks I decided to branch out . ( An example was that the leader of the group , Juicy , was threatening Spartan before I knew him to pick me up from the coast after I died ) The server was relatively small and the owner was a cool guy , I was on the coast and he moved a Military offroad to me ( Which I dubbed Sasha ) and told me they were having a BBQ in the bottom left of the map , they brought two Urals full of food and guns . Set up barricades , and set up some campfires . I drove over there and some ass took potshots at us as I drove near to the point and I just gunned it there . While there I met someone who was typing in a convincingly russian manner . He told me that there were a couple of stray tents that people abandoned long ago near his base . After the BBQ we were driving out of town and someone popped out with a rifle and took shots at us . This russian guy hopped out of the car , and with a M16 in burst fire put so many rounds into the bandit so quickly I thought he had a M249 . Bandaged , got back in his car , and lead us to the base near gorka . Turns out that that guy was Spartan using an alias , and for the next couple of weeks I operated with him looting , hoarding , looting , hoarding . Fucking about , the norm . And eventually I logged on one day and all my shit was fucked except my car . After I got hit a few times I got on with an alias and met Spartan near Novy and I told him that someone was burning me and that shit was fucked . Spartan and I ended up using aliases and basing up west of Pobeda dam , while at the prep for another BBQ one of the guys from Juicy ’ s group told the moderator about how they “ stole some kids stuff , and killed him five times playing it off as accidents and bandits ” After that we weren't bothered as the server pretty much died , but after people who I had been friends with for a couple of months stabbed me in the back and felt no remorse left me with some trust issues and Spartan was the only people I could trust . We fell out of contact for about nine months until I started playing War Thunder and contacted him again . We've been playing together since . TL :D R friends stabbed me in the back , Spartan stood with me through it all , and I know I can trust him . This all happened around 2013 starting in September so my memory is a bit foggy about it all , but that's the gyst of it .

14697	highly highly	RB	> Yeah , it went from none to 22 . Fortune 500 wise the first female CEO was in 1972 for the [ Washington Post ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_women%27s_firsts ) . > Shareholders like to see women CEOs Do you have any evidence to support that ? Because I highly highly doubt that . As shareholds only care about the stock price going up , they care less who is the CEO and care more about performance . > Well , if there were a lot more women CEOs , suddenly that rare value proposition ( wow ! a woman CEO ! ) becomes a lot less valuable ( meh , she's just another CEO ) . If she's not as valuable to the company , they would strongly consider paying her less . IE , more women CEOS = this pay gap closes . What makes you think the pay gap will close here especially when women tend to out perform men when it comes to making money for a business ? If anything companies will pick up on this and that pay women more than men .
14726	so so	RB	There's a lot of programming options , yes , but they're all incredibly easy to use ! You don't have to edit everything at once . Maybe you just want to change your color set , or maybe you want to switch from Tilt Function to Speed Function . You can access these features separately and quickly . You can program any feature in under 30 seconds . Out of the box , the default modes are freaking dope too , so even if you don't want to program at first , you can still get the full Element experience . Then just program it piece by piece as you get more curious :) Full disclosure , I am on the Emazing marketing team , but I really want to educate the community and help everyone figure these things out ! Lots of new technology to sift through here . Ultimately these things are just going to be so so awesome for gloving .

17103	who who	WP	> Or is it based off location ? I think more correctly , it might be based off of age more than anything else . When I was 21 , I didn't want kids . I'm now 25 and still don't want them . In comparison , I have coworkers and friends who are in their early 30 ' s who have their first kids . Also some people who are around 35-38 who have kids who are like 5-6 years old . But , there are unique situations . My one friend is 24 and married and just started working with me . We were casually talking about how he wants to buy a new car and his wife legitimately said that if they want to do this seriously , they need to plan for one that is able to have a kid inside it . In comparison , I have friends who who in their late 30 ' s who are extremely single and aren't even fathoming the concept of children . As a lot of people have already said , your surrounds generally dictate your thoughts on this . If I went back to my homework , I'm sure that I'd be popping out kids . A lot of people I went to high school started having kids when they were 18 . Now , I live in a city which has more working 20 - somethings , so we're all focused on living our lives and our careers over something like kids .

17459	the the	DT	My issue has absolutely nothing to do with KOS . If I see someone with a backpack , weapon , and / or helmet equipped ... I'm going to shoot at them . I'm a rabid PvPer who prefers open-PvP and full player looting . KOS doesn't bother me one bit . My issue stems from this : * John Smedley ✔ @j_smedley * * we're toning down guns and ammo you find btw . way too much out there . * * 1:44 PM - 2 Feb 2015 * * John Smedley ✔ @j_smedley * * we want it to be a survival game not a gun show . * * 1:45 PM - 2 Feb 2015 * H1Z1 is still a gun and ammo show . Many players burn weapons into metal bars because there are so many . Personally , I don't even pick up any weapons from loot spots , anymore . They've become so common that passivity is the norm with regard to looting them . Ammo is everywhere . If anyone states otherwise , they aren't being honest . Figure out 3-4 loot routes , loop one or two , then bank . Go back out and hit the other loops . Rinse . Repeat . Ammo , ammo , and more ammo . Whether Jimmy likes it or not , he's one of the main faces of H1Z1 , and since he's the combat guy , the criticism about anything related to it will be directed at him . I'd find it very , very hard to believe that he has zero input on the the loot frequency part of * his * work . It's clearly his preference . CS , eSports , BR ... That's him . It's fine and all , but it also makes me worry about the sandbox nature of this game and if it will ever be realized . Sandboxes are not only about giving , giving , and giving . It's about ebs and flows , winning , losing , finding , not being able to find , et cetera . We don't have much of that in terms of depth . It's simply live , die , then easily more of everything . That's it . I love guns in games . I love PvP ( I'm still waiting for a no-zombie server ) . On the other hand , I was under the impression this game would be a little different than others when talking about being armed to the teeth pretty much at all times . The more Jimmy puts in , the more the vocals will be screaming for " more , more , MORE ! " . And with that , will come frequency . It can have a trickle down effect to other systems , too , since there isn't any scarcity . One being the player economy they want to have happen . That is a general loot system problem , though ( dumb minimum loot quota they have ); not just a gun and ammo one .

Every time the clicking sound went away for a while but always came back after 50-100 km . It was driving me nuts during climb . My LBS worked on it at least 3-4 times as well . There was no correlation whatsoever with riding in the rain or dirt . I finally solved the issue by switching the crank from the original S - 500 ( I think ) to to a force 22 . So far , it's been about 1000km without that awful sound . Apart from that , it's a great bike !

19128	but but	CC	OK - I'm going to be ' that guy ' and take some stick here . I'm going to cover myself in caveats in this paragraph , but there are going to be a lot of people disliking what I say in the second . Yes - the ' kink community ' ( IRL , on FetLife , and of course , here on Reddit ) needs to support , and train , people in how to recognise and avoid abuse . Yes the community needs to recommend safety measures to take with new partners . Yes , the community needs to actively exclude anyone known to be abusive , including , obviously , those who ignore Safewords . But but but . We can't try to create a parallel system to our nations ' legal systems . There's the impression given by the linked article that ' the community ' needs to somehow invent ways to identify and prosecute ' creeps ' . Well we can't . We can't invent kangaroo courts based on hearsay and rumour . The legal system exists for a purpose . It's been honed . It's been proven by trial and error . It's imperfect , but it does work , on the basis of a random selection of our peers judging all evidence , and finding it to be beyond reasonable doubt . The linked Salon article describes Maggie Mayhem telling an audience about her rape . If the experience was as described , then it was clearly , legally , rape . Take the kink out of this and what is still left ? Assault . Rape . But the key thing missing from the description is whether the police and courts were involved . This story is nothing to do with kink as such . I hope , without knowing more of this story , that Maggie , and the court system , prosecuted this man , and that he was found guilty , and punished for his crime . What we * can * do is train people in how to negotiate relationships . How to express consent and how to withdraw it . How to find partners they can trust . How to be safe on a first date . After all , meeting someone for the first time for kinky bondage play , is a very , very vulnerable high risk version of a normal first date , ( and we would tell our daughters all sorts of safety advice if they were going on a non-kinky first date - or even , traditionally , open the door to the new boyfriend while casually holding the shotgun ) The kink community is * soooo * sex-positive ( which is , nominally , lovely ) that sometimes new subs seem to forget all the common-sense safety rules their parents taught them at their knee as children : 1 . Don't trust someone you've just met 2 . Don't go home alone with them before you know them better 3 . Don't go alone with someone who real name you don't even know ! 4 . Tell someone where you're going 5 . Meet in public places first 6 . Don't go home with someone until you've seen how they interact with others , with their friends , with waiting-staff This old-fashioned stuff somehow seems to get forgotten in the NRE excitement , when new subs are contacted online by potential abusers posing as experienced Doms . Maybe I'm just too old , because I remember life before the World Wide Web , and maybe the next generation born won't have come across the 1993 cliche that [ " On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog . " ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog )

19374	that that	IN	> he's positing that someone created him . Hmm no . Getting theists to support their claims by using the Socratic method is not a form of claim-making . It's a way to get them to think about whether the claims they are making * make sense * . This question is designed to point out the problem with the origin of a deity . If a god always existed then why can't the same be true for the universe itself ? If , however , it began to exist on its own , then why can't the same be true for the universe itself . Of course , the theist is free to say that there are an infinite number of gods that created each one in turn , and we're left with an infinite regress not much different than an endless cycle of big bangs and big crunches . Asking where God came from is not positing that God has a creator nor is it making the claim that that god actually exists - it's just a way to challenge people to support otherwise unfounded claims .

19716	very very	RB	I've seen some pretty terrible posts in your sub , seems like your angry fans are very very vocal in putting Tampa down . Sure , there's some good ones , but the majority of the posts I saw seem to be implying that Tampa's fan base is a bunch of idiots . The posts he linked to were pretty bad , but he's not * trying * to make Detroit look bad , you guys made those posts yourself . I'm sorry if you don't agree with it but that's just the way it is . I'll be honest , I'm not a huge fan of finger pointing like OP is doing , but it's a free forum for expressing ideas and opinions and I'm not going to sensor him , even if it does make us look like sore winners .

The Sultana disaster in 1865 , in which a ferry boat exploded on the Mississippi , killed over 2400 Americans , for instance . Ditto for the General Slocum sinking which killed around 1800 iirc

20904	for for	IN	You really dictionary-ceptioned me there so this may not be the best response since I'm on my phone but here goes : First you defined the word ' just ' using a self-referential description . The definition of just I see on merriam-webster.con says , " agreeing with what is morally right or good " and " treating people in a way that is considered morally right . " So by that definition regardless of if they willingly gave their labor for free , I don't think it is just to take advantage of that for profit . And what I am suggesting is possible , it is called a workers cooperative . If the entire community ( company ) has equal say in the direction of the company and they know that they are more competitive working together than separate ; wouldn't it logically fit that if they are greedy they will work together to generate more profits as a community ? As far as generating revenue for expansion it works like any other company , the owners would take less pay in order to pay for the things the company needs . And by owners I mean everyone in the co-op . And if you wanted to work for for lower pay than someone else and apply for the same job as someone else my co-op and I would choose the person that fits in best and add them to our list of equal owners . Lastly , i disagree that democracy is a failure , at least not direct democracy .
20975	the the	DT	To start , I'm not really well-versed in TES geography and lore . Vedril , an Altmer , was raised as a warrior in the Summerset Isles , and wandered around all of Tamriel to help others and slay evil . Y'know , the whole wandering hero thing . He was rather well-versed in spells , learning to summon beings from other realms and Restoration spells ( my explanation to why he starts with Healing ) to sustain himself in fights , as he didn't trust his skills in Alchemy . He was also an accomplished blacksmith and enchanter , and took pride in his creating his own equipment and collect artifacts . Contrary the the stereotypes against Altmers , Vedril respected other races ' culture - however , he did not respect people that attack him or innocent people . As a mage and a warrior , Vedril followed two rules : Never kill innocent people and never use Conjuration for raising the dead : they've died once , they don't need to die again . Though he called himself a wandering hero , he had no problem stealing from others and manipulating others through his words . He eventually wandered into Skyrim , as he heard of the Civil War and wanted to help those in need . However , as he entered into the border , Vedril ran into Stormcloaks . Assuming he was a Thalmor , the Stormcloaks began attacking him , which caused Vedril to attack them in defense . That's when the Imperials showed up and captured the Stormcloaks and Vedril . As he was approaching Helgen , he then blamed the Stormcloaks for his capture , and would join the Imperials for his new-found hatred from Stormcloaks - not for their worshiping of Talos , but because they got him captured and essentially made him lose all of his equipment .

21062	many many	JJ	I have to be frank - - this is pretty fucking stupid . It's one thing to go fight as an individual without children , or one that is older and has grown children , but to leave one's young children in such a situation is pretty low . The good she can do in this world through being there for her children is many many times greater than the small contribution she can make to YPG . Before you label me sexist , I'd say the same thing for men in her circumstances . I'm guessing that she suffered from some level of ennui / existential despair in the United States and wanted to find a new greater life purpose . Interestingly enough , that ennui is also what often motivates people to embrace Daesh / other jihadi groups . The [ of course significant ] difference lies in what values are embraced as representing the ' higher purpose . ' Fortunately she chose those of PYD . edit : I looked at her facebook . She's with the Peshmerga in Iraq , not YPJ in Syria .

I have spent my whole 36 years in this area and this part of Yam has been a bone in most locals ass since the the 1970 ' s.Where is quarry sits you can not see from the hiway . At one time you could camp by the lake for free but that trail head is now closed . Then some ass when and took out all the hangers that were on the bluffs at yam . now they are taking more of the quarry . This is not right . Get off your lazy butts and see this before its all gone . I would love to have the day off and chain my butt to it to protest , as this are need more protection . on a said side bar - Fee's are to go up again under the new budget also .
22296	really really	RB	I couldn't disagree with you more . Sure , players lose out on the rabbit hole of super character customization , but there were too many problems with DC creep and OPness in the earlier versions where the goal has and still seems to be " line up around the bad guys and roll dice until they die " I like that you can make a character in 5e in 20 minutes and have a plan for his future . I like that a DC 20 check is really really difficult at level 1 and still mildly difficult at level 20 . I like that there aren't 25 skills to put points into , maiming everyone not intelligence / skill point powerful from doing things other than combat . I find the simplification and condensation of the rules lend themselves to much more lively role play by everyone , and not just the skill sluts in the party .

24254	of of	IN	Here's one I put together . It's almost 300 growable assets , but not just random . I spent a lot of time to balance it so there were adequate number of new buildings for every level and building size . [ Growable Asset Pack Version 2 ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428047780 ) To give you and idea , below are some screenshots showing what my current city looks like using this asset pack . This is a relatively new city and only has Level 1 , low density buildings , but very little repeating visible . Once certain areas start to level up , and I start adding in high density buildings , will be even less repeating . I will see the same level of variety as my city develops . [ Image 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/LfKmqzF.jpg ) [ Image 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/WwmzvTc.jpg ) [ Image 3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/RBUqs1L.jpg ) Another tip to get rid of of repeating buildings is to force different size buildings when zoning . If you zone a block , first manually zone some different random building sizes that take up about 20 % of the area . Then let those grow . Then fill in the zoning for the blank areas . You will get much more variety doing this .

24728	his his	PRP$	Oh , wow ... there's a lot of misinformation in that thread ... The top comment's casualty figures are fabricated from thin air , as his his claim that Tacitus reports them--Tacitus reports 80,000 Iceni dead , to 400 Romans ( and an approximately equal number of Roman wounded ) . That would be 200 Roman dead for each Briton , and only 100 Roman casualties for each Briton--but Tacitus ' numbers are clearly wrong (8 0,000 is a ridiculous number--Caesar reports that at Alesia each of his soldiers received a Gallic slave from among the captives , so there were at least 40,000 captives * from all of Gaul * there , which makes this figure , like Dio's 230,000 soldiers in the Iceni army , patently absurd ) as well . Tacitus also notes that the Romans fell on her camp and slaughtered the women and children , vastly increasing the casualty count . I also don't know why that comment has a reply to it that claims that Boudica attacked while the Romans were in the middle of " rotating " their legions , which he explains means that the legions in Britain were returning to Rome and were being relieved by new legions--not only did the Romans not do that , in the case of Britain it's nonsensical . It was a principle of the Roman army after Augustus standardized the number of legions that permanent frontier garrisons were manned by legions ... permanently . Legions would remain on-station for years , sometimes centuries at a time , only moving if they were going on a campaign or , like the four legions that invaded Britain , if they were being moved to another province , which was rare . This was a standard practice , it's how we get towns like Mainz that were originally permanent legionary camps . The four legions in Britain appear in our sources as being stationed in Britain for several centuries after this--the Twentieth , Agricola's legion ( which participated in the initial invasion and in the Iceni revolt ) , was almost certainly still there when Constantine III withdrew them to support his bid for the empire . The reason for Boudica's initial success in sacking Camulodunum was that whereas the city was literally right to the south of her kingdom , the legionary camps were miles away , in York and near Wales--the Ninth legion , trying to salvage the situation , marched in unsupported and was ambushed , with its infantry destroyed , though its cavalry managed to get the standards out . Suetonius , the provincial governor , marched in with the Fourteenth and parts of the Twentieth ( all three of these legions had taken part in the initial invasion and all three would remain in Britain for centuries later ) and snuffed out the rebellion . Actually ... there's really not much in that thread that's not , at best , half-truths For what it's worth , the OP's assumption that Boudica and her daughters met their unjust treatment as an official order , which as we have seen is the exact opposite of what Tacitus says , is not actually in the rather poor wikipedia article that he linked to , it's an addition of his own

25370	the the	DT	Welcome the the lemon party . The best party .
25372	the the	DT	> If they would bounce When a bouncy ball hits the ground , it starts to deform , and flatten . It looks kinda like the earth does , when compared to a perfect sphere ; the equator starts to bow out . As the ball compresses , it stores more and more potential energy . Kinda like a spring , the more you compress it , the more it resists beign compressed . Until all of the kinetic energy from fallling is A ) converted into potential energy and B ) wasted energy transfered to the ground . That's when it bounces back up . The issue with a huge height like the Empire state building is the physical limits of the rubber . It's only going to flatten out so much before it tears itself apart trying to flatten out more - The larger that equator becomes , the more the the rubber is getting stretched , until it rips . If I was at work right now , I'd model a sphere in SolidWorks and figure out the spring constant for deforming it . I don't really want to pull out my machine design book and derive it using Castigliano's Theorem ( but you totally can if you want ) . After that it'd be figuring out the terminal velocity of a bouncy ball , and then with KE =( 1/2 ) mv ^ 2 , we'd find approximately how much energy is being stored in the ball on impact . I'm not sure how much would be lost to the ground , though . Then some stress-strain equations to see if the rubber could withstand stretching as much as it would , and bam ! you'd know if the ball would bounce or not . And we'd know the kinetic energy on impact , and if we knew how much was lost , we could set up KE-PE = E ( nonconservative ) , figure out the potential energy , and then using PE = mgh , find the height . I remember seeing a video on ants , and how they can't die from falling ; they weigh so little that they reach terminal velocity after like 3 feet . So I googled how much a bouncy ball weighs ( 11grams ) , and it makes me wonder if the ball would reach terminal velocity quickly enough to survive the fall . I know a bouncy ball outweighs an ant by a factor of at least 50 , maybe 100 , but it's still entirely possible it would survive
25824	it it	PRP	I read this article , did it bother anyone that it seemed more like a whisper campaign with no verified sources for their information , than a well investigated story ?
